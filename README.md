# Udacity-data-analytics-nanodegree-project2

In this project I extracted data from weRateDogs twitter site using twitter api for my analysis. In addition to this dataset I also downloaded archive and Image data from udacity's server programmatically using python libraries.

After which I was supposed to assess the data for issues such as tidiness, quality and completeness.

I assessed the datasets both visually and programmatically, identified the issues cleaned and combined the three datasets for submission together with an act report of your findings and wrangle act report.
